JWST’s observations combine near- and mid-infrared light, while HST’s observations showcase visible light. Complementary views show predominantly stars (HST) and obscuring dust (JWST). In JWST’s high-resolution infrared images, the gas and dust stand out in stark shades of orange and red and show finer spiral shapes with the appearance of jagged edges, though these areas are still diffuse. In HST’s images, the gas and dust show up as hazy dark brown lanes, following the same spiral shapes. HST’s images are about the same resolution as JWST’s, but the gas and dust obscure a lot of the smaller-scale star formation.Image and text credit:NASA, European Space Agency (ESA), Canadian Space Agency (CSA), Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI), Janice Lee (STScI), Thomas Williams (University of Oxford), Physics at High Angular resolution in Nearby GalaxieS (PHANGS) TeamLearn more about this combined image from Webb and HubbleDesktop and Mobile Wallpaper DownloadsDesktop 3456x2234 (HD)Jul 29, 2025JPEG (3.51 MB)Desktop 1920x1080 (HD)Jul 29, 2025JPEG (1.44 MB)Desktop 3840x2160 (4K)Jul 29, 2025JPEG (3.44 MB)Mobile 1440x2960 (18x9)Jul 29, 2025JPEG (4.94 MB)Mobile 1242x2688 (5x9)Jul 29, 2025JPEG (1.86 MB)Mobile 1080x2560 (21x9)Jul 29, 2025JPEG (3.62 MB)Mobile 1080x1920 (16x9)Jul 29, 2025JPEG (1.46 MB)Discover More about GalaxiesGalaxy BasicsWhat are galaxies?
