  "Essentially, the trial judge didn’t properly guide the jury on how to weigh this complicated confession sequence. The court believed this mistake unfairly influenced the jury's decision.",
  "The court ruled that obtaining a confession before informing someone of their rights, and then getting them to repeat it afterward, violates established law. This is against the constitution.",

  "Etan’s disappearance and the later murder of Adam Walsh fundamentally altered how Americans viewed child safety.  It ushered in a new era of heightened awareness.",

  "Jonathan Haidt, a professor and author, highlights the unintended consequences of this new approach. He believes it may have negatively impacted the independent development of children.",
